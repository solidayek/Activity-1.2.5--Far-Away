In this exercise you will write a program to compute the distance between any two geo locations.

In this program you will ask the user for four numbers.

    starting latitude
    starting longitude
    ending latitude
    ending longitude


Then, using the GeoLocation class, compute the distance in miles between the two locations.
A sample program run should match exactly as below:

Enter the latitude of the starting location: 48.8567
Enter the longitude of the starting location: 2.3508
Enter the latitude of the ending location: 51.5072
Enter the longitude of the ending location: 0.1275
The distance is 208.08639358288565 miles.
